# PCA Formative — Advanced Linear Algebra

PCA on Africanized upper secondary / out-of-school data. Numeric columns only, mean imputation. Data: [`Upper Secondary.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/komalkhetlani/out-of-school-rates-global-data/data?select=Upper+Secondary.csv) (Kaggle).

**Recommended:** [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) — upload the notebook and `Upper Secondary.csv`, then run all cells.

**Local:** `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter`. Put the CSV in the same folder as the notebook (or set the path in the first cell).
